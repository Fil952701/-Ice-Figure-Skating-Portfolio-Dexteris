## 🧠 Why Figure Skating Matters
Figure skating is more than just sport — it develops:
- **Precision** — every movement must be controlled and intentional
- **Discipline** — consistent training to refine complex skills
- **Focus under pressure** — performing jumps and spins with accuracy in real time
- **Creative expression** — blending athletic ability with artistry

These qualities directly influence my professional life in **AI research**, **music performance**, and **game design**, where precision, discipline, and creativity are equally essential.
